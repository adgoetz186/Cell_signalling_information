Code used to generate data for paper "Information Transmission by Individual Cells"

Navigation:
The project was structured around generating plots for a paper. As a result programs which are directly used for making a specfic figure are stored in a directory which indicates the figure and subfigure. For example, the program contained in Figure_Generating_Programs/Figure_2/C/ generates figure 2C, which can be viewed in Figures/Figure_2/C/.

Custom function libraries are stored in functions/, this encompases the bulk of the machinery of the program with functions/mutual_information_functions/MI_Calculation_Functions.py in particular being a central function library as it contains functions for obtaining the mutual information as well as finding the optimal input distribution and corresponding channel capacity.

At the current time the paper manuscript is under construction. It will be linked here to provide context for the programs when completed. Until that point, the "Mutual Information Poster.png" will be provided to give context and scientific motivation for many of the algorithms and figures contained in this project.
